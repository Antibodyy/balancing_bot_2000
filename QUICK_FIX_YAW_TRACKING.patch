## Quick Fix for Yaw Tracking

Apply this patch to immediately improve circular motion tracking.

### What This Does
Applies an empirical correction factor (61x) to the yaw inertia to match
the actual MuJoCo simulation response. This accounts for wheel rotational
inertia that the simplified linearized model ignores.

### Apply the Fix

Edit `robot_dynamics/continuous_dynamics.py` line 259:

```python
# BEFORE:
yaw_inertia = params.body_yaw_inertia_kg_m2

# AFTER:
yaw_inertia = params.body_yaw_inertia_kg_m2 * 61.0  # Empirical correction for wheel inertia
```

### Test the Fix

```bash
# Run circular motion test
python scripts/debug/debug_velocity_circle.py --circles 1.0 --velocity 0.2 --radius 0.5

# Expected improvement:
# - Yaw rate tracking should improve from 86% error to <20% error
# - Robot should follow a curved path instead of straight line
```

### Why 61x?

From experimental measurement (scripts/debug/diagnose_yaw_coupling.py):
- Linearized model predicts: 60.0 rad/s² yaw acceleration
- MuJoCo simulation produces: 1.0 rad/s² yaw acceleration
- Ratio: 61.0x discrepancy

This factor compensates for wheel rotational inertia which acts as
a "gear reduction" between motor torques and body yaw acceleration.

### Limitations

- **Empirical fix**: Based on simulation measurements, not first principles
- **MuJoCo-specific**: Factor may differ on real hardware
- **Better long-term**: Include wheel DOFs in state vector (see CIRCULAR_MOTION_ANALYSIS.md Option 2)

### Reverting

To revert, change line 259 back to:
```python
yaw_inertia = params.body_yaw_inertia_kg_m2
```
