We would like to thank THE GOAT Dr. Francesco Borelli for introducing this fascinating subject in the ME C231A lectures in such an inspiring fashion. The support of Akshay Thirugnanam and Fiona Kopp throughout the semester have also allowed us to dive as deep into the subject as we have. 

It should be noted that the use of an AI agent was made to speed up the software development and ensure modularity of our code. This allowed us to design more tests and gain more insight on the matter, as design parameters were more easily changed. We acknowledge the code structure would have been less advanced without the use of these AI tools.

implementation details and all the code, both for simulation and generated plots as the hardware, are available in the linked public GitHub repository.
