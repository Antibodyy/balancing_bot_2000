Two-wheeled inverted pendulum (TWIP) robots present a nonlinear, unstable control challenge that becomes even more demanding when slopes, steering, and hardware constraints are considered. This work implements a sixth-order, slope-aware dynamic model, designs a linear MPC controller that runs at 16~Hz (65~ms sampling) with warm-started CasADi solves, and validates the controller in MuJoCo across perturbation, circular-motion, and yaw-tracking scenarios. We compare the MPC performance to an LQR baseline that shares the same plant assumptions to highlight how constraint handling improves recovery on slopes and under torque saturation. The same controller stack is deployed to the Pololu Balboa 32U4 hardware via a Raspberry Pi interface, sharing code between simulation and real-time execution to accelerate experimentation. Current results show that the simplified dynamics plus warm-started MPC achieve real-time feasibility while revealing yaw-model limitations that motivate future wheel-inertia modeling.
